# Silicon Apocalypse: IoT Smart Home Simulation #

A Cisco Packet Tracer simulation of a self-sufficient, "zombie-proof" smart home designed for disaster scenarios. This project, completed as part of a Diploma in Computer Engineering, models an IoT-based system for survival, focusing on renewable energy, resource management, and automated defense.

## Technical Overview ##
 * Simulation Tool: The entire system is designed and simulated using Cisco Packet Tracer.
 * Network Topology: IoT devices are connected in a star topology to a central home gateway.
 * Connectivity: The internal network runs on a 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi connection. A central switch is used to manage communication between connected devices efficiently.
 * Core Components:
   * Power: Renewable energy is supplied by solar panels and batteries, managed by a smart grid.
   * Security: Includes motion sensors, security cameras, electrified fences, and motion-activated traps.
   * Control: The system is monitored and managed remotely via a smartphone app.
 * Automation: The system uses automation scripts to manage energy consumption, environmental controls, and security protocols. For example, a "Code Red" condition is triggered when motion is detected, activating all defenses
